Major Developmental Research Issues and Methods
-----------------------------------------------
* Nature and nurture

* Critcal and sensitive periods
  Critical Periods - Age range during which certain experiences must occur for
  development to proceed normally
  Sensitive Periods - Optimal age range for certain experiences to spur normal
  development

* Continuity vs. discontinuity

* Stability vs. change


Arborization
------------
* An overgrowth of neurons that people are born with (200 billion neurons).
  Which halves by the time of adolesence, which is called pruning.


John Piaget - Cognitive Development
-----------------------------------
* Brain builds schemas to achieve understanding
There are two options:
* Assimilation - New experiences incorporated into existing schemas
* Accommodation - New experiences cause existing schemas to change


Piaget's Stage Theory (1920s)
-----------------------------
1. Sensorimotor Stage
   * Range: Birth-2
   * Understand world through sensory experiences and physical interaction swith
     objects
   * Begin to acquire language
   * **Object Permanence** - Understanding that objects continue to exist even
     when they can no longer see it.
2. Preoperational Stage
   * Range: 2-7
   * World represented symbolically through words and mental images
   * Symbolic thinking enables pretend play
   * Does not understand conservation
   * Thinking displays animism, inanimate/animate are all the same
3. Concrete Operational Stage
   * Range: 7-12
   * Easily perform basic mental operations involving tangible problems and
     situations
   * Often have difficulty with problems that require abstract reasoning
4. Formal Operational Stage
   * Range: 11-12 (12-20)
   * Can think logically about concrete and abstract problems
   * Able to form and test hypotheses

Erickson
--------
1. Basic trust vs. mistrust
   * Range: 0-1
2. Autonomy vs. shame/doubt 
   * Range: 1-3
3. Initiative vs. guilt
   * 3-5
4. Industry vs. Inferiority
   * 6-12
5. Identity vs. Role Confusion
   * 12-20

Adolescent Egocentrism (Elkind, 1967)
-------------------------------------
* Overestimation of uniqueness of feelings, experiences (personal fable)
* Oversensitivity to social evaluation (imaginary audience)
