Brainstorming Using 9.3.1 Methodology
=====================================

Scenario
--------
You and other programmers are developing a communications system in disaster
zones (such as Manhattan on 9/11) for first responders. Users will be able to
communicate with each other, with supervisors near the scene, and with other
emergency personnel. The programmers plan to conduct the entirety of the
testing for the system in a field near the company office.

Decision to be made: 

Role of decision maker: Software Developer on a team of programmers. We are
responsible for giving birth to this project. It is our baby.

All the people & organizations affected (the stakeholders) + their rights
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Programmers

* First Responders

* Victims of a disaster

* Company that owns communications system


Risks, issues, problems, and consequences, and to whom they pertain
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Potential benefits. Identify who gets each benefit.
---------------------------------------------------


Cite applicable legal considerations and class terms
----------------------------------------------------
