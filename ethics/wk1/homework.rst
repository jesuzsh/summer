Homework for Day 1

1. I'm a guest student at UMB this summer, and I plan to graduate with a No Major
   degree from Tufts, in Medford, this August. My internships and courses were all computer
   science, but getting the major didn't work out for me.

2. I believe we'll do whatever it is we like to do on social media more and
   more. I try to be indifferent about it, but there's a growing feeling of
   needing it.

3. I know encryption methods exists to help keep data "private and safe", but it
   sounds like it helps protect you from strangers accessing the data. Not
   exactly protecting you from the company you choose to give all your data to.

4. I think NSA puts aside privacy for powerful people decide to be the greater
   good.
