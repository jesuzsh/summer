Homework. This is a late response that needs no replies

Day 1
-----
1. I'm a guest student at UMB this summer, and I plan to graduate this summer.
   I care about loved ones, video games, health and other.

2. I believe we'll do whatever it is we like to do on social media more and
   more. I try to be indifferent about it, but there's a growing feeling of
   needing it.

3. I know encryption methods exists to help keep data "private and safe", but it
   sounds like it helps protect you from strangers accessing the data. Not
   exactly protecting you from the company you choose to give all your data to.

4. I associate fake news with misinformation. I'm not a fan of fake news being
   more influential than real news.

5. I think NSA puts aside privacy for what powerful people decide to be the greater
   good. I do not know Cyber Command.

6. Edward Snowden is a popular whistle blower that I believe cannot safely come
   back to the U.S. I do not know Chelsea Manning or Reality Winner.

7. Drones provide a new perspective when looking at our Earth. Like a drone
   that's on(or will be?) Mars flying around and getting these first-time
   images. Using them in warfare and along our borders appears like an unfair
   advantage against populations that don't have drone-level resources.

8. AI(Artificial Intelligence) takes input from its environment and outputs 
   what the system believes to be the next move.

9. Censorship feels like a tool to control. It limits exposure to material
   deemed "not for my people."

10. I don't know much about Copyright infringement/illegal
    downloading/streaming. Where there's a will, there's a way.

11. Crytpocurrencies have ledgers that keep track of every transaction. The
    ledger is agreed upon (and immutable?), and many computers work out a hash
    (hash table-like) that adds a coin to the blockchain/ledger.

12. I would not have robot assisted surgery. I had my achilles reattached last
    year, and with a tendon that vital, I'd rather trust human
    hands with human decision making and human reaction time. Robots
    have to earn my trust. Like driving a car is easy so a robot can do that
    all day.

13. Done

Day 2
-----
1. (deontological or utilitarian) I spend time watering a coffee plant over the
   course of a year. After that year I can yield coffee beans and make the best
   coffee in the world with them, or at the very least finally understand the
   realities and limits of this plant, which is also valuable. 

2. (positive or negative right) I get my paycheck and I decide to spend every
   last cent on beef jerky.

3. (deontological or utilitarian) It snows a lot overnight and I go out in the
   morning and help every person I see shoveling their driveway. I come back
   home and sleep from exhaustion and not that much muscle will be gained.
