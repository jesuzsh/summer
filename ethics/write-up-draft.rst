Paper: Ethical Analysis
=======================
By Jesus Garcia

What are the ethical aspects posed by this paper?
-------------------------------------------------
Amazon working conditions - "people are being forced to pee in bottles."
Amazon tax history - "they exploit loopholes and tax havens to pay close to
nothing in taxes."
These are the two ethical situations presented in the article.


Outline of the paper: 

Background
----------
What is the news event: Amazon trolling representatives

The Players
-----------
Amazon News (@amazonnews)
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren)
Dave Clark (@davehclark)
Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders)
Rep. Mark Pocan (@repmarkpocan)
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC)

Cognitive Biases
----------------
There are a few biases:
* Confirmation Bias - seek and absorb info that is aligns with original thot
  - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
* Intertia Bias - sticking with an idea even if you should update it
  - Amazon News

Logical Fallacies
-----------------
* a Tu Quoique by Dave Clark
  - "All we want to know is why the Sen is one of the most powerful pols in VT
    for 30+ yrs and thei min wage is STILL only $11.75."
* Straw Man by Amazon News
  - "One of the most powerful politicians in the United States just said she's
    going to break up an American company so that they can't criticize her
    anymore."

Work in Progress (WIP)
----------------------
Include brief explanations of any major developments between the state of the
issue before it was newsworthy and the present.

Thought Process
---------------
What is the issue? Two ethical situations decribed above. 
Have they always existed? No

To be the company that it is today, it was forced to grow and adapt. The first
entity to do it at this scale. These issues are a by product of Amazon getting
to it's current size.

Draft
-----
A troll is an entity that responds to posts on social media in a way that
pokes fun or goes against the ideas in the original post. Trolls are everyone
and they usually go by unnoticed, but when we see one of the largest tech
companies in the world, Amazon, playing the part of the troll, people take
notice. Especially if respectable state representative s are the ones being
trolled. This is exactly what we see in an article from The Verge that
highlights two aspects of Amazon's identity being underfire, their tax history
and employee working conditions. 

Amazon is ranked #2 on the Forbes' Fortune 500 ranking (Forbes, 2021).
Additionally, you'll have to go out of your way to find somebody that isn't
your grandmother who knows who's Amazon. Therefore, I wouldn't say that this
is your trypical troll. If we look at one of the Twitter comments stated in the
article from @amazonnews, "One of the most powerful politicians in the United
States just said she's going to break up an American company so that they can't
criticize her anymore." We can see that this is a **straw man** fallacy after
rephrasing Sen. Warren's expression "fight[ing] to break up Big Tech" with
Amazon's, "break up an American company" (Statt, 2021). Who would dare want to
break up an American company? I see two obvious view points, Amazon and, with a
little clumpling, various state representatives. Now to start things off from
the first perspective, Amazon. 

Amazon is simply a behemoth of a company that most people do not take the time
to fathom. Additionally, its founder, Jeff Bezos, being among the richest men in the world
acts a  testiment to the power behind the company. The company's rise came with
a societal norm shift of the way people acquire physical goods in the new
online world. There are two points mentioned in the article that warrant a
response from the big tech icon. The first comments are against Amazon's tax
history stating, "they exploit loopholes and tax havens to pay close to nothing
in taxes" (Warren, 2021). In response to this Amazon claims, "Here are the
facts: Amazon has paid billions of dollars in corporate taxes of the past few 
years alone" (Amazonnews, 2021). Off the bat, Amazon seems to have countered
Senator Warrens statement. A defensive move from the behemoth. The giant
appears to play in defensive mode when they feel it to be the move. Warren
is clear about asking for Amazon to be better when it comes to their
contribution, so understandably, Amazon feels attacked and must go on the
defensive with their response. Being as powerful as a company like Amazon
probably is, they are doing anything that they feel like doing. In this case
they are not going to allow a prominent politician attempt to stain their name. 
The second point mentioned in the article is in regards to theliv
