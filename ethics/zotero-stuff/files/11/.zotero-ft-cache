Giant corporations like Amazon report huge profits to their shareholders – but they exploit loopholes and tax havens to pay close to nothing in taxes. That’s just not right – and it’s why I’ll be introducing a bill to make the most profitable companies pay a fair share.

I hope that you have figured out how to stop them from passing the increases to their customers. When I owned a business & leased a building, every time they increased bldg owners taxes, they passed it on to us so that I had to close my business b/c I couldn't afford the increase

I had a great meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel today. The ties between our two nations are stronger than ever — and I’m excited to welcome her to the White House next month to continue our work.
