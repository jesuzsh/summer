Homework for day 12 and 13.

Day 12
------
Reactions:
* Aaron: He found himself stuck between a rock and a hard place. It's
  insensitive of the entities and institutions coming for him in the way that
  they did. The natural sadness expected from this situations must have been
  immense.
* JSTOR: JSTOR is correct in their decision to release documents to the public
  and not pursue charges, but I guess JSTOR is just JSTOR and they have no real
  power. 
* MIT: They have egos and bad people at the helm of the institution if they
  allowed something like this to happen to someone like Aaron. Like Aaron's
  mentor/lawyer mentioned in the interview, MIT should be a place that advocates
  and defends open data, and in this case it looks like they didn't do much for
  Aaron. 
* MA prosecutor: If they are simply following procedures and laws then they
  aren't holistic enough for the power they have, in my opinion. 

2. Reasons:
   * For - An international law against hacking would prevent interference into
     the affairs of foreign countries. Preventing interference ensures that a
     country is operating they way that country intends too, without outside
     influence. I think this is important to preserve the individual integrity
     of governments.
