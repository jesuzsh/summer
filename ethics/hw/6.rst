Homework for day 15, 16, and 17.

Day 15
------
1. I think the definition of skill is important here. If I were to define skill
   as overall knowledge of the game and individual team performances, then I
   would say that it plays a larger role than chance. 70% skill, 30% chance. I
   say that fantasy sports should be an exception to US gambling laws because
   it's significantly different to something like slots which is more 1
   dimensional than something like looking at the shooting percentages of the
   athletes and comparing them to the competition.

2. Gambling online appears to be more free than in-person casino gambling.
   Additionally, it looks less restrictive and comfortable when it's being done
   in the comfort of your home. Ethical arguements:
   * For: Eliminates in-person casino's environment that promotes that gambling
     happening within.
   * Against: Online gambling provides way too convieniences for something that
     could become as serious as a gambling addiction.

3. My first reaction is the T&C government is very aware of gambling's
   ramifications and is putting citizens first, in this instance. Arguments:
   * For, Government perspective: This will ensure that the people gambling are
     those with money, and the government can expect them to be putting more
     money on the line, compared to citizens making <75k.
   * For, citizen perpective: The lower class are kept safe from the possibility
     of a gambling addiction.
   * Against, Government: They miss out on the money that could be made if they
     allowed the entie re population to gamble.
   * Against, citizen: Citizen's can't gamble and enjoy the same activities as
     tourists/upper class. They don't have the freedom to gamble.
   I don't think we should have a similar law in the US. Only because the US is
   known as the land of the free. 

4. I would lean toward companies exploiting vulnerable addicts. I do not think
   the CEOs of these companies are good-hearted people. 

5. Done.

Day 16
------
1. I do not think Universal Basic Income is the best answer because it doesn't
   solve the problem that most of the population does not have the skillset needed
   for "more advanced" jobs. A better answer would involve teaching people the
   skills needed to do the advanced jobs. A temporary UBI for situations like
   covid-19 are extraordinary circumstances and makes sense in terms of helping the
   general population in these hard times. 

2. A pro is more tranquility. There are no longer external events that could
   cause a person to gravitate outside of their dwelling. Another pro is
   increased focus in whatever it is you've decided to put your new-found time
   into. A con is that time with the people I've grown a connection with over
   the years was cut short. People were forced to go back home, so there was no
   clean closure. Another con would be that people were forced to have drastic
   changes to their routine, and everyone was forced to adapt. Not having a
   choice to adapt or not never feels too good. In-person classes always had
   more variety. It was just how the structure of courses was, historically. It
   was the optimal choice.

3. Yes, if that's what it means for people to be treated humanely, then yes. I
   would do the same for a phone. In reality, I wouldn't because all that is
   luxury. This also means that these items would be less common because not
   everyone can afford the current price, much less price doubled. 

4. We are taking advantage of them. Their work is of the same caliber as some
   one in the US, so they should be paid the same. There's no reason to value
   the time of a foreign worker less than that of a US worker, especially if the
   work is the same. People's time is valuable. 

5. I want to say an organization like the UN should be in charge of that, but
   the only thing about the UN I know is Model UN from Parks & Rec. So I would
   say a similar entity with a focus on gobal human rights should set a standard
   on what it means to be humane so more people get treated equally.

Day 17
------
1. My initial reaction to the story is to feel bad for the teacher. It's
   unfortunate that she was exposed in this way by kids. 
   * The teacher - I'd be embarrased and a little angry at the student, but at
     the end of the day just be like, "This is unfortunate. Time to figure out
     how to get out of this predicament."
   * The student - "Look what I found, nothing bad could ever happen to me."
   * Student's parent - Surprised and angry at the teacher for allowing
     something like this to happen.
   * Any other student - In awe that something like this actually happened, then
     move on in a week. 
   * Any other student's parent - They probably start wondering what kind of
     teachers are at that school and wonder if it's a good environment for their
     kid. Either that, or they don't care at all. 
   * Head of district - This is bad for our reputation, need to punish to fix
     things. 

2. 
   * a. I think the result is messy. It started off with inappropriate comments,
     and I don't think any company would look good if they defended the joking
     developers. I'm not surprised they were fired, but I am surprised that the
     hactivists group Anonymous got involved because of what I assume was the
     way Richards addressed the situation. However, I'm still confused why they
     would get involved and DDoS her personal blog and the company she worked
     for. This definitely changes my perspective a bit.

   * b. I'm not from Colorado, so I can't speak on the culture of the state or
     that town in particular. As a teacher, you should be inspiring and a good
     example for the students you're supposed to be teaching. I think there are
     also pros to giving the students professional role models, just so they
     understand what it means to be serious when you have to. I can see why she
     was fired. She probably isn't the best person to prepare these students for
     what they're going to school for.

   * c. I don't agree with firing the officer. He is young and it was a joke,
     and it could have been an opportunity for the wisdom-filled elders of the
     department to teach the young officer a lesson and help him grow and
     understand why he is saying is insensitive. I don't like his behavior but
     turning it around and making the department better as a whole is better
     than firing him in my opinion.
