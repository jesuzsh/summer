Turing Test
-----------
If the computer convinces the human subject that the computer is human, the

Misrepresentation, hiding problems and inadequate resonse to reported problems.

Conflicts of Interest

Phenomenom in which the probability of an individual providing help is
inversely related to number of people who witness the situation.

Diffusion of Responsibility

Usually cited as the explanation for the Bystander Effect

"in a large group of people, people may feel that individual resonsibility to
intervene is lessened because it is shared by all of the onlookers."

Streisand Effect

Defaults are extremely powerful.

Creeping Normalcy
-----------------
Incremental change results in calm acceptance, whereas abrupt change with the
same results causes outcry.

Logical Fallacies
-----------------
1. **Ad hominem** - "To the man" Attacking your opponent's personal traits
   instead of the content of their argument
2. **Anecdotal Evidence** - Basing conclusions on personal experiences instead
   of empirical evidence.
3. **Appeal to Emotion** - The manipulation of emotional responses instead of
   basing arguments on sound logic.
4. **Argument from Authority** - Arguing that if an authority says something,
   its veracity (trueness) is beyond doubt.
5. **Balance Fallacy** - The presentation of an issue as being more balanced
   than th eevidence supports. Ascribing equal value to both sides of an
   arguments, regardless of evidence or merit. Related to "Middle ground"
   fallacy. Two causes of misinformation: Proportionality & Omission
6. **Begging the Question** - Circular reasoning. 
   An example -
    Interviewer: "Your resume looks impressive but I need another reference."
    Bill: "Jill can give me a good reference."
    Interviewer: "Good. But how do I know that Jill is trustworthy?"
    Bill: "I can vouch for her."
7. **Burden of Proof** - Rather than proving that your claim is true, this
   fallacy puts the onus :underline:`on your opponent` to prove it is false.
8. **Composition/Division** - Assuming that what's true about one part of
   something has to be applied to all (or other) parts of it. Ex, protons and
   neutrons are invisible so anything they make up is also invisible. (False)
9. **The Fallacy Fallacy** - The thought that if someone commits a logical
   fallacy, their point is disproven. "Eating vegetables is good for you. I
   have a fiend who eats vegetables all the time and she is really healthy."
   "That's a fallacy of anecdotal evidence, vegetables must not be healthy!"
10. **False Dichotomy** - Views or choices are inaccurately limited to one of
    two options.
11. **Post hoc ergo propter hoc** - Implying casual relationship when there is
    none. Equating causality with correlation.
12. **Red Herring** - Focusing on a non-issue instead of the argument at hand.
13. **Slippery Slope** - Negating arguments with unsubstantiated conjecture of
    consequences. Can be fallacious or valid.
14. **Straw Man** - Presenting an altered version of the opponent's argument so
    that is seems absurd, then disproving the weak argument.
15. **Tu Quoique** - "You too", Equating others' lack of reasoning as
    proof/justification of your own. Ex, "you accepted bribes for your
    campaign!" "Well, so did you!"

Automation Bias
---------------
The tendency to trust automated systems (and even ignore contradictory correct
information if it comes from a non-automated source).

Automation Complacency
----------------------
Insufficient attention to automation output because that output is viewed as
reliable.

Key Aspects of Privacy
----------------------
1. Freedom from intrusion (being left alone)
2. Control of information about oneself
3. Freedom from surveillance (from being tracked, followed, watched)

Secondary Use
-------------
Data collected for one purpose may find other uses.
When using this term, we must describe the primary use before talking about
secondary use.

Invisible Information Gathering
-------------------------------
Collection of personal information about a user without the user's knowledge.

Data Mining
-----------
Searching and analyzing masses of data to find patterns & develop new
information or knowledge.

Computer Profiling
------------------
Analyzing data to see which people are likely to engage in a certain behavior.

Informed Consent
----------------
Permission granted in full knowledge of possible consequences.
* **opt out** - Person must request (usually by checking a box) that an
  organization *not* use information
* **opt in** - The collector of the information may use information only if
  person explicitly permits use (usually by checking a box).

Fair Information Principles
---------------------------
1. Inform people when you collect information.
2. Collect only the data needed.
3. Offer a way for people to opt out.
4. Keep data only as long as needed.
5. Maintain accuracy of data.
6. Protect security of data.
7. Develop policies for responding to law enforcement requests for data.

The 4th Amendment
-----------------
The law that grants U.S citizens privacy from the government.

The Privacy Act (1974)
----------------------
* Limits disclosure of records held by agencies of the federal government to
  other agencies, organizations, and individuals, although...
* in an omission that disappointed privacy advocates and ignored the
  recommendations of the secretary's committee, it did not incorporate the
  private sector in its scope.
* As of 2007, Dept. of Homeland Security and ADIS are exempt.

Olmstead V. United States (1928)
--------------------------------
* Supreme Court **allowed** the use of **wiretaps** on telephone lines without
  a court order.
* Interpreted the Fourth Amendment to **apply only to physical intrusion** and
  only the search of seizure of material things, not conversations.
Applies to the federal government. Once a federal government has you personal
information, they aren't allowed to share that information with other agencies.

Katz V. United States (1967)
----------------------------
* Supreme Court reversed its position and rulled that the Fourth Amendment does
  apply to conversations.
* Court said that the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. To intrude
  in a place where reasonable person has a **reasonable expectation of
  privacy** requires a court order.
* Reversal of the Olmstead V US decision.

Kyllo V. United States (2001)
-----------------------------
Court stated that where "the government uses a device that is not in General
Public Use, ... the surveillance is a "search" and a warrant must be obtained."

1968 Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streats Act
-----------------------------------------------
* prohibits GOVERNMENT agencies from wiretapping without a warrant.
* codification of Katz V. United States (1967)

Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA)
----------------------------------------------------
extended the 1968 wiretapping laws to include electronic communications. 
Before ECPA, service providers who had your data relinquished your rights to
it.

Communications Assistance For Laws Enforcement Act (CALEA) 1994
---------------------------------------------------------------
Amended ECPA: requires telecom equipment to be designed to ensure that the
gov't can intercept telephone calls (with a court order or other
*authorization*). Has been upheld in several law suits.

National Security Agency (NSA)
------------------------------
"CALEA on steroids" - intelligence gathering agency
* 1952: Formed to intercept and decode WW2 messages, only allowed to spy on
  foreign entities
Patriot Act (2001): [Sec. 215] "the entirety of US communications may be
considered relevant to a terrorism investigation if it expected that even a
tiny minority may relate to terrorism" -> **US now included in NSA
surveillance**... but most civilians were unaware (until 2013). Main
surveillance provisions EXPIRED: June 1, 2015 -> USA freedom act

Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) 1978:
--------------------------------------------------
* established oversight court for the NSA
  * Both are government entities
  * Judges appointed, not elected
  * aggregate numbers submitted to congress once/year.
  * Section 702 of FISA update in 2008 allows for warrantless surveillance of
    Americans online.

Rule 41
-------
* Set procedural guidelines for courts (what time they open, which holidays the
  courts are closed, etc.)
* The DOJ wants to "update" Rule 41 with extensive surveillance permissions for
  law enforcement
  * Hiding one's ID online would constitute probable cause for a warrant to
    remotely hack the computer (using a VPN)
  * Any computeer that is part of a botnet system would be fair game for
    surveillance and remote hacking.

Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Part 1)
---------------------------------------
2002 update: Changed regulatory structure of telephone services: ISPs are info
services, not common carriers -> they are not subject to regulation by the FCC
-> ISPs can do/charge what they want.
(Part 2)
"NO PROVIDER... of interactive computer services SHALL BE TREATED AS A
PUBLISHER of any information provided by another information - content
provider."

Chilling Effect
---------------
Discouragement/suppression of legal behavior (including speech)

Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA) - X
--------------------------------------------
* First major Internet censorship law
* Made it a crime to make available to anyone under 18 any obscene or indecent
  communication. 

Children's Internet Protection Act of 2000 (CIPA)
-------------------------------------------------
* Requires schools and libraries that paticipate in certain federal programs to
  install filtering software.
* **Upheld in court**

Can-Spam Act 2003
-----------------
* Law against sending strangers adverts for porn or marketing stuff
* "Not illegal to send that stuff, but you have to follow certain rules."
* Criticized for not banning all spam, legitimized commercial spam
