Amazon keeps trying to troll US Congress members in perplexing new PR strategy

Who is Amazon trying to convince?

Amazon is intensifying its bizarre online public relations strategy of picking increasingly petty fights with sitting US Congress members, with the company’s Amazon News account on Friday shifting targets from Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

“You make the tax laws @SenWarren; we just follow them. If you don’t like the laws you’ve created, by all means, change them. Here are the facts: Amazon has paid billions of dollars in corporate taxes over the past few years alone,” the account tweeted Thursday in response to a critique from Warren that Amazon exploits “loopholes and tax havens to pay close to nothing in taxes.” There’s a growing mountain of evidence pointing out how Amazon pays very little in taxes compared to its annual sales and profits.

Then, earlier today, the Amazon News account struck back at Warren yet again after she responded outlining her intentions to regulate the company , taking an even more trollish turn and accusing the senator of trying to “break up an American company so that they can’t criticize her anymore.”

Somehow, one of the most powerful and valuable companies on Earth has decided its bold new PR strategy should involve playing immature semantics with a US senator.

This latest dust-up caps a surreal week for Amazon’s PR team, which continues to wage these battles anonymously and without attaching an executive’s name to any of its childish internet taunts and misdirection.

The same account falsely asserted earlier this week that it is untrue Amazon warehouse and delivery workers find themselves forced to pee into water bottles. The Amazon News account lied about this — despite the wealth of evidence to the contrary — in a late Wednesday tweet in response to Pocan calling out the company for hypocrisy.

The whole debate started when Amazon’s Dave Clark, its senior vice president of worldwide operations and so far the only executive to publicly spar on Twitter under their own name, criticized Sanders. The context, of course, and why Amazon’s PR division may be kicking up so much dust is that Sanders had publicly announced his plans to travel to Alabama today to speak in support of the state’s historic Amazon warehouse unionization campaign .

Clark attacked Sanders on Tuesday of this week and then again yesterday after Sanders mentioned his trip to Birmingham, and Clark has since gone quiet except to retweet the Amazon News account’s latest Warren dig.

Amazon’s defensive tweets, specifically the one about pee bottles, ignited a torrent of backlash, photographic evidence, and yet more investigative reporting from The Intercept , Vice , and others proving that countless Amazon workers have, in fact, resorted to urinating into bottles and even defecating into bags because of the time and efficiency pressures imposed upon them.

All of this leads us to believe that Amazon either thinks it is so powerful and untouchable that it can openly taunt the few Congress members who’ve expressed desires to regulate Big Tech, or the company has simply handed the Twitter reins to an internet culture warrior who thinks they’re battling in the trenches of a Breitbart comment section. Maybe both.

Amazon is an absolutely disgusting organisation.
I mean I totally encourage them to dig their own grave even deeper and being able to see amazing clapbacks from the likes of Gravel Institute and AOC , but also just regular Twitter users serving massive ratios, so by all means Amazon please continue!
I hope it gets broken up someday. It’s almost too big to be properly regulated.

Whether it’s Walmart or Amazon or whatever comes next, they’re not at fault. They’re a product of our laws. The senators are at fault, they just don’t like Amazon telling them it is.

Yea, if Amazon is following the laws then what’s the issue? I mean honestly? I understand that a senator may want to show how absurd the laws are by noting the tax they pay, but it’s not Amazon’s fault for paying it

It’s exactly Amazon’s fault among others as well why laws are not changing. They are fighting hard with all means to make sure laws don’t change.

People are naïve if they believe it’s up to senators to come up with some law and put it in effect. I remember like 20 years ago there was some financial bill or to some extent something like it and inside of it on few pages there was a law that prohibits people from suing GMO crops companies if there were any health issues caused by consumption of their crops. Who do you think has concealed that inside of such bill? Monsanto of course.

So you’re conflating Amazon.com with Monsanto?

The problem with this analogy is Amazon.com workers get a minimum of $15 per hour, healthcare, and the opportunity to advance within the company. Isn’t this exactly what Bernie Sanders is demanding for the rest of the country?

For your analogy to work Amazon.com would have to be lobbying for laws to eliminate the minimum wage, then adding language within any subsequent law that prevented legal liability for the negative consequence of not paying a living wage.

You act like "these senators" haven’t tried to enact laws to curtail big corps. Most of their Democratic (and all of their Republican) colleagues are bought and owned by big tech, big oil, etc., and any legislation they try to enact is instantly killed. It’s only by increasing public awareness can they pressure "blue dog" democrats and "moderate" republicans to enact said laws.

    any legislation they try to enact is instantly killed.

By whom? Other legislators or government officials?

I can’t tell if you’re serious or not, but corporations are only doing what the laws allow them to do. Senators aren’t victims, they are enablers. They need to change the way that corporations can engage public officials, and limit the financial influence of the political process.

But alas, they won’t because it’s not in their self interest to do so.

By other Senators and Reps in Congress, Biden’s appointees for various depts, etc… Which part of my comment did you think wasn’t serious? The only way to actually enact any kind of change is by repealing Citizen’s United and ending the revolving door where politicians get positions on a company’s board after their term in Congress.

Warren and Sanders are last on the list to criticize about not enacting laws. They’ve been at the forefront of trying to do something. But thanks to Manchin and Sinema, nothing will ever get done. I hope West Virginia passes a voter suppression law that makes Manchin feel like his own seat is in danger. Maybe then he’ll vote to end the filibuster. Or maybe his head is really that deep in his own rear end that he’s willing to let Republicans steal his own seat in the name of compromise.

This move makes less than zero sense. There’s Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress, a Democratic president, and the Republicans are pissed off enough about the whole Parler kerfuffle and "big tech" kvetching that even they might not be opposed to throwing a few body blows into the mix. Antagonizing electeds is about the last thing you want to do when you have strident antitrust legislators like Warren and Sanders in positions of power with the legal muscle behind them to actually do something.

The problem is people continue buying from Amazon. Some people buy at least something from Amazon every single day. I know I used to do that.

Until people stop buying from them, this crazy non-sense will continue to happen.

We can argue and fight over Twitter or pass laws to prevent them from doing their nasty crap, but it all ultimately falls upon the people to stop buying stuff on-line from Amazon, no matter how convenient it is.

I know it’s terrible, and I continue buying from them.

No, the problem is they’re not regulated properly. Is there technically other places to shop online? Yes. But they’re pretty hard to beat for simplicity, selection, and price. (For me personally, buying everything I get from Amazon elsewhere would cost at least twice as much, and there’s quite a bit of stuff that I just wouldn’t be able to get anywhere else.) People using Amazon is just a consequence of them trying to get by in a completely fucked up system. Stop spreading their propaganda blaming the people they exploit.

Agreed. We have not stopped completely, but the vast majority of our purchases are no longer on Amazon. Over the last 18 months we have found fantastic alternative online and off-line places to buy things.

We went four weeks recently without an Amazon purchase. Not bad.

We have moved away for several reasons, including that Amazon just does not care at all about the quality of the goods sold. All manner of crap is sold on Amazon in ways that are beyond deceptive – the products are not what’s advertised, the delivery is slow, the reviews are fake, etc. I’d rather just open the Costco app and see what they have – with a company like Costco I know that an actual human buyer has vetted the product and Costco is tracking carefully any problems with the product. Costco might only have 1 or 2 alternatives compared to 100 on Amazon, but I have high confidence it will be good.

Plus, privacy.

Maybe the senators should enact laws to force higher taxes vs. criticizing companies for following the letter of the law. Saying they lobbied for laws is a cop-out. Senators and congresspeople happily accepted the lobbying, they could have stopped it years/decades ago. Now it’s all a PR stunt to go after the "Big Tech" boogie man. Oh, and Amazon has 1 million (with an M) plus employees. What’s the % of pee-bottle incidents as a total % of employees? How does that compare to the general population? And thanks AOC for posting a meaningless memo from a dispatch supervisor telling drivers to use a bathroom instead of pooping in bags. I’d be much more impressed if these politicians can produce a standard operating procedure telling employees to poop in bags vs. these ridiculous attempts at creating a storm out of a handful of people with weird behavioral issues.

I agree. I think Warren’s complaint that Amazon is somehow dodging taxes is completely bogus.

While I don’t agree with the approach Amazon is taking with these criticisms, they are correct that the US Congress is responsible for how much tax Amazon pays, not Amazon.

And regarding the minimum wage issue, I’m pretty tired of seeing Bernie bitching on TV about this – pass a law. You missed this last opportunity, what are you going to do now Bernie? It’s your F’ing job to raise the minimum wage, you and your colleagues.

I’m well aware of how the US government passes laws.

Bernie is just – ineffectual. I’m a pretty liberal guy, I’m just kind of sick of Bernie’s constant outrage.

I’m not really clear on any legislation Bernie has gotten passed. I was curious, so I went to Wikipedia and here’s a quote:

    While he has consistently advocated for progressive causes, Politico wrote that he has "rarely forged actual legislation or left a significant imprint on it." According to The New York Times, "Big legislation largely eludes Mr. Sanders because his ideas are usually far to the left of the majority of the Senate… Mr. Sanders has largely found ways to press his agenda through appending small provisions to the larger bills of others." During his time in the Senate, he had lower legislative effectiveness than the average senator, as measured by the number of sponsored bills that passed and successful amendments made.

Bernie – quit complaining and go get some work done.

You clearly don’t understand "how the US government passes laws" nor are you "a pretty liberal guy."

The dude’s been pushing for the legislation this country needs for decades, and it’s his fault that corporate Dems and Republicans don’t want to anger their lobbyist overlords? How do you suggest he "get work done" when most of his colleagues have strong financial incentive to oppose anything he does?

Also, lol at that cherry-picked quote.

It’s easy to stand on the sidelines and rant & rave, it’s hard to write laws that get passed. Bernie is a ranter.

And fwiw, if it were up to me I’d move the minimum wage to at least $25/hour. Bernie is shooting too low. $25 is the approximate equivalent of what it was in 1968, adjusted for inflation.

If Amazon paid more taxes than they had to them competitors could beat them at their game. It needs to be a level playing field and Warren needs to get the tax laws changed rather than play childish politics of envy.

No, the point is just that Amazon pays the taxes that US law tells them to pay. As bitchy as they are, Amazon is right about this.

It’s an old game for politicians to complain about how much companies pay in taxes, and it’s never been an honest game. If they don’t like it, go write new laws and leave the cameras behind.

Amazon’s ""point"" is completely nonsensical: Warren literally said she plans to introduce a bill to tax them properly, to which they replied ‘why don’t you make a law to tax us properly.’ It’s complete pants on head.

I don’t pretend to know what’s going on at Amazon with this nameless voice of theirs on the internet – I think it’s a terrible idea, and super un-professional. Also, they are probably working against their own interests here with their tone.

That said, as I mentioned, this is an old story. Politicians complain in public about how low taxes are for the rich and corporations, while they are the one writing the laws. Obviously, it’s a very complicated subject – you’ve got lobbying, competing political agendas, etc.

But the basic point remains that all companies (if they are law abiding, which most are) pay the taxes they owe. Consider Apple paying taxes in Ireland and the conflict with the EU. Apple won that battle, as they should have. Ireland didn’t write the law for Apple, when the law was written Apple was not the huge player it is today.

Anyway, this kind of kabuki theater is a waste of time. The Democrats are mostly in control, and they can pass a tax bill with big increases for the wealthy and large companies without Republicans through reconciliation, just like the Republicans did. So do it already.

    Warren literally said she plans to introduce a bill to tax them properly, to which they replied ‘why don’t you make a law to tax us properly.’ It’s complete pants on head.

Businesses don’t have to, nor should they be required to not re-invest cashflow.

What Warren is proposing makes no business sense. Amazon.com’s growth is directly the result of the company re-investing its cash flow back into the business. Most of the time public companies can’t do this because shareholders/analysts/investors demand quarterly profits as a metric of the success of the business. In the case of Amazon.com, they overlooked profits because of the strength of Bezo’s vision for the business. This is rare, but there have been some notable cases, Tesla, Salesforce etc.

Warren is making the argument that a pizza shop owner shouldn’t be able to buy new pizza ovens using the cash flow generated from selling pizzas. She’s saying that the shop owner should pay taxes on his profits, then buy the ovens from what is leftover.

It’s a stupid argument that would kill millions of businesses. Amazon.com is correct to lobby against this kind of nonsense.

She’s playing to people who don’t understand what she’s saying.

Are the politicians complaining the same ones giving the breaks? Maybe some, but definitely not Warren. A giant corporation saying "Don’t hate the player, hate the game" is what’s dishonest when giant corporations are the ones who lobbied for the game to be this way. They even got another round of tax cuts from the Republicans a few years ago. Warren and Sanders are trying, but they’re only 2 Senators. There’s plenty of blame to go around but the actual politicians voting for these breaks and the corporations that lobby for them are where they lie.

Do you consider just sales? But what about countries that have the bulk of Amazon R&D, but no direct sales? Or sales, but only from abroad?
Or a company that does r&d in one country, but manufactures in another country. Companies get tax benefits in different countries, like Ireland, because they want the jobs that they provide. Is that fair? or will you force, lets say Intel, to manufacture just in the US?

You think Amazon could or would exist as a nationalised company? Name one other government run entity that is efficient and effective at what it does. Don’t take free market capitalism for granted because it is the only system that has created what everyone takes for granted. Plentiful supply that is cheap. The price of nearly everything approaches zero over enough time with capitalism.

Capitalism is a force for good by tying ones financial gain to ones quality of service or quality of goods provided. Socialism turns greed into a vice by giving people the legal right to steal from the most successful among us.

As someone who grew up in the Soviet Union, I totally agree. It’s so funny and sad watching all the young "socialist" Americans, imagining a world were nationalizing amazon will improve anything for anyone.

The beauty of capitalism is that you can vote with your dollars on every purchase not just every four years. If you don’t like Amazon then don’t use them for your goods and services. If you still do but dislike their policies then you can’t really complain as it’s easy to use someone else.

I think this strategy by Amazon may backfire but I can only assume they’re trying to get the millennials on their side using new media. Let’s see how it plays out. I think saying Amazon is forcing people to pee in bottles is ridiculous though.

The main problem with capitalism (as well as democracy in its current state) is that majority of people are just dumb. You can vote with your dollars as much as you want, but hundreds more will vote opposite. It’s the same as most Americans vote with their dollars for ICE trucks to drive them mostly to grocery stores nearby.

There are no tax "loopholes", only tax laws. Amazon is 100% right.
I am 100% certain that any senator and commenter here, wants to pay the least amount of taxes, and collect all tax benefits he or she can. Amazon is 100% right – there are laws, and finding the way to pay the least amount of tax is just the correct thing to do. Nobody sane would do anything else.
A company that sells stuff internationally, and has international workers, pays the tax according to international laws. There are no "loopholes". It’s all demagoguery.

That you think that pretty much invalidates everything your wrote before this sentence.

Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com literally started the company out of his garage. Today Amazon.com employs 1,000,000 directly. This growth came from reinvesting free cash flows back into the business. Contrary to what Sanders believes, businesses do not exist to pay taxes.

Amazon.com pays its American workers a minimum of $15. Many make $100,000+. They all get good healthcare and the opportunity to advance within the company. Also, they all pay taxes.

I get that Bernie Sanders wants Amazon.com to pay more to blue-collar workers but it’s not really his call, nor it shouldn’t be.

Sanders should devote his efforts to helping more entrepreneurs start new businesses to create competition for unskilled workers. That will raise wages organically.

Amazon.com is consistently rated in the top 3 for customer service/ satisfaction. It has 100 million Amazon Prime subscribers. These customers are paying for the right to buy products from its affiliated merchants because they like the service being provided. They’re not unhappy.

The business is way more popular with Americans than any politician. Trump tried to make the company a bogeyman. How did that go? Sanders and Warren will fail too because they’re doing what all politicians do: Looking for a scapegoat for their own failed policies.

I’m glad that Amazon.com is pushing back. Too many companies just politely accept all of the political B.S.

If Amazon.com is a failed American experiment I would hate to see what a successful one looks like.

Warren’s response was equally trollish and childish.
