Climate-Related Morphological Variation and Physiological Adaptations in HoSa
=============================================================================
At present it is accepted that Homo sapiens evolved from equatorial, sea-level
populations in Africa who then spread across the planet over the psast 100,000
to 200,000 years.

How early pattersns of migrations AND mutations in early ancestors led to
genetic variations and adaptations that humans still have today
* Temperature played a role in different human traits. Bergmann's Rule.
  Adaptations associated with the need for heat conservation or loss
* Polynesian population that settled in remote pacific islands. This feat
  required much energy, so their large mass may have been a favorable trait
  retained from those times. 

Specifically, you should discuss migrations of early modern humans 60k yrs ago
* 60,000 years ago a few thousand humans left Africa, and eventually led to all
  the humans throughout the world. Arriving at different parts of the world
  created new groups that were isolated from one another. 
* 46,000 years ago, populations inhabitied the subarctic regions of Siberia and
  Eurasia.

Mutation in SLC24A5 gene 8k yrs ago
* This was the mutations responsible for giving Europeans lighter skin. It was
  only a substitution of G-to-A, a single base change that led to this
  mutation. It came from people who migrated from the Middle East.

Explain why there is actually no biological basis for race. And if "race" is
not a biological or genetic reality, what is it?
* After taking samples from different "races" and mapping their genome, Craig
  Venter, a pioneer of DNA sequencing declared that race had no genetic or
  scientific basis.

* The genes and switches that impact melanin determin the color of human skin.

Pick a climate-related physiological adaptation and explain it
* Adaptations to High-Altitude Hypoxia
* In order to survice in high-altitude environments, the body, starting from a
  reduced inspired oxygen supply, must develop mechanisms to mobilize
  sufficient oxygen for cellular metabolism.
* Between sea-level and high altitude there is a difference in oxygen
  saturation, and in order to compensate for these differences the body must
  elevate its rate and depth of breathing. After a week or sow this elevation
  diminishes.
* Amount of oxygen in the blood increases due to an increase in
  hemoglobin-carrying red blood cell concentration.
* Tibetans who settled over 25,000 years ago, have the high-resting ventilation
  of acute exposure of lowlandesr.
* Andean populations that settled 11,000 years ago have similar ventilation
  rates of those at sea-level.
* The hemoglobin concentation stays lower in Tibetans for much higher altitudes
  than Andeans. 
* Tibetas have a sea-level hypoxic ventilatory responce, while Andeans maintain
  a very low HVR. 
  * functional mechanisms explaying Ethiopian patterns are unknown.
* Erzurum and colleages reported a ten-fould incrase in nitric oxide (NO),
  compared to low-altitude people. NO is a vasodilator, which increases blood
  flow.
