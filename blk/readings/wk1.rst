Notes from African History and Western Civilization
===================================================
By Boniface Obichere

Goals
-----
He states that is goal is to examine the present inadequacies of treatment of
African history in Africa and overseas, take a glance at what could be done to
eliminate this sad state of affairs, and maybe share a few thoughts with you on
African history and the Third World Movement.

To examine the present inadequacies of treatement of African history
--------------------------------------------------------------------
* Interpretations are polarized. (John Hancock example)
* One way of thinking from Professor Dike (Paraphrased by Obichere)
  * "that there were people who had a pathological unwillingness to accept
    evidence about African history and African contributions to world
    civilization."
* Obichere believes that the basis of this controversy is the inadequacy of the
  treatment of African history and, secondly, the false interpretation that has
  hitherto been given to African history.
* Another inadequacy: a textbook used at the university level is the "bible of
  the history of Western civilization".
  The book contains very little on Africa, or the dealings between Englishmen
  and Africans. The views of Africa that this book depend on are people that
  have spent such a small portion of their life in Africa.
* If you been leaning too much to the right, you must lean extra to the left to
  finally be upright.
* Lectures have very little to say in the formulation of the contents of some
  of the courses they teach. This illustrates the degree to which the chairman
  affects the development of the curriculum and research in his department
* Most of the material being published at present by African intellectuals is
  identical in tone with what was being published by Englishmen in London in
  the 1930s; in other words, it is a question of the old wine in a new jug.
* It is the unrealistic colonial rule that degrees other than those obtained
  from England or Commonwealth universities are "worthless."
* Some African writers cannot get publishers because they don't toe the line.
* Another inadequacy: is the question of selection of non-important themes in
  African history. Ex- What is "indirect rule" compared to other themes in
  Nigerian history? A West African university deciding to do this seems to 
  Obichere to be irrelevant, or to have the priorities wrong.
* Crucial criticism: the question of anonymity. It was part of conial policy to
  impose anonymity and do it on Africa and Africans. "We don't have names."

Take a glance at what could be done to eliminate this sad state of affairs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Africa needs an indigenous press (to solve the crisis of publication).
* "African history should then be treated as African history and the important
  themes should be investigated. One would like to see studies of African
  political structures, structures of states, the functioning of these states
  should be studied in detail and the personalities should be studied."
* So, it behhoves us today to examine this question of anonymity, and in our
  writing of African history to make efforts to pinpoint the personalities who
  acted in Africa before the Europeans and after the Europeans arrived on scene
  We should endeavor to clense the historical record of Africa.

A few thoughts on African history and the Third World movement
--------------------------------------------------------------
* In the academic field, worthwhile endeavors are being made in the Third World
* For identity in Africa and for identity in the United States by the blacks,
  African history has a role to play
